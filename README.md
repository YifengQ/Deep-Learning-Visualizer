# Deep-Learning-Visualizer
This project’s primary focus is to create an application that serves as a graphical user interface for neural networks concerned with image processing. The user of the application is able to input parameters for their neural network and either test or train it. The user is then able to see a graph of the network’s loss vs epoch in real-time as well as input vs output images with false positives, false negatives, etc. This is important for researchers and machine learning engineers to be able to identify weak spots in their networks faster. In particular, this will help engineers who are focusing on image detection to evaluate the performance of their neural networks as they train.
